Here I will periodically upload the most recent build of the app. 

Install Instructions:
- Click on the most recent build. 
  - Builds use the following naming scheme: Synth_v(month)-(day)-(year)
- Click "view raw." 
  - This should download the file. 
- Once downloaded, click on the download and it should automatically install. 
  - If it doesn't install, you'll need to go to your web browser app settings and enable the option titled "Install Unknown Apps"
