## Changelogs 
- **8-27-2021 (Latest Build):**
  - Added feature: Waveform selector.
    - You can now choose between Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, and Square waves
  - Audio stuttering issue alleviated
    - Previously, pressing 4 notes would cause stuttering. Now the threshold is ~7 notes
  - UI layout now resizes based on phone orientation
- **8-24-2021:**
  - All UI components have been rebuilt from the ground up to fit into the new Jetpack Compose framework. 
  - Added feature: Piano can support any range of keys; it is no longer limited to one octave. User control for this will be added soon.
  - Added feature: Harmonic Series Editor gives the user more control over their sound.
    - Sliders for controlling the volume of each overtone
    - Reset button (sets all sliders to zero)
    - Random button (adjusts sliders by randomly changing parameters decay, floor, ceiling, and filter)
  - Added feature: Pitch Bend
  - Added feature: Signal preview
    - similar to realtime-audio viewer, but instead shows 4 periods of the signal you've generated with the Harmonic Series. 
- **8-10-2021:**
  - Added feature: replaced noise effect with harmonic overtones
    - this is the first step towards additive synthesis. For now, the user can only change the harmonic range; the volume of each overtone exponentially decays automatically . However, under the hood, these overtones can be manipulated with more control, and this control will be given to the user in a later update. 
  - Fixed bug: all keys had to be released in order for changes from [-] and [+] buttons to apply 
  - Fixed bug: when holding two or more keys on the piano, releasing one key would cause all keys would release momentarily
  - Fixed bug: audio visualizer was not properly centered and had a range of 0.0 to 2.0 rather than -1.0 to 1.0
  - Fixed bug: generated audio was off-pitch
- **8-3-2021:**
  - Added feature: audio visualizer 
  - Fixed bug: noise level indicator to display incorrectly
- **8-2-2021:**
  - Fixed bug: excessive memory allocation that caused app to slow to a halt and even crash
    - this yields significant performance improvements
- **7-27-2021:**
  - Added feature: harmonic white-noise effect
- **7-25-2021:**
  - Under the hood improvements which lessen the severity of the memory bug. This means that more notes can be played simultaneously without slowdown or crashing
  - Added feature: the user can change the current octave
